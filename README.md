2) Run `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ankalot/Bifractalizer.git` to get source code.
3) Run `build_first_time.bat`. For the next builds use `rebuild.bat`. You can also build a release version (`build_release.bat`).
4) Now you have VST3 and Standalone versions. If you want other types, then change the settings in cmake.
  
## How to debug:
To debug the program through VS Code and any DAW, configure the `.vscode/launch.json` file.
